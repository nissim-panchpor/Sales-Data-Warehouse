# Sales-Data-Warehouse
### In this project, I built a data warehouse from scratch, followed by Tableau visualizations to draw insights from the data.

### Steps:
	1) First, I gathered data and performed a preliminary analysis of the data.
	2) Then, I created a dimensional model according to the data and business requirements.
	3) I created staging tables and inserted data in it.
	4) I created dimension and fact tables. Inserted data into them using Merge queries.
	5) I created views to aggregate the data, for easier analysis and visualization.
	6) I explored the data in Tableau. Created visualizations to gather insights for measures by slicing and dicing with the dimensions.
